// Evaluates user-defined threshold rules against live telemetry samples.
//
// The engine holds one state entry per rule: when the threshold was first
// breached and whether the rule is currently firing. On each sample it:
//   1. Reads the metric value from the sample.
//   2. Checks the condition.
//   3. If breached, marks the onset timestamp (if not already set).
//      If the breach has lasted ≥ durationSeconds, fires the rule.
//   4. If the condition is no longer breached, clears both the onset and the
//      fired state (yielding a "cleared" transition when it was firing).
//
// Transitions are the same shape as the built-in alert engine so the same
// delivery paths — webhook, desktop notification — handle both kinds.
